## Smart Product Solution
Smart, connected products are completely transforming the value chain. As a result, companies are redefining their industries and rethinking nearly everything they do. The ability for smart products to monitor themselves, their environments and enable remote control, optimization, and automation allows manufacturers to think about their business in new ways. Freshly available features and functions can be delivered directly to their products and users to improve revenue and margins.

Smart, connected products have many of the same physical components that products have always had, but also have new features that make them more intelligent. They are embedded with sensors that enable communication and data transfer between the product and the web-enabled systems of the maker of the product, as well as the user of the product. These sensors collect information on a productâ€™s environment and various interfaces now enable users to control products. To support this evolution, a new technology stack is needed to enable smart, smart products.

The Smart Product Solution is a deployable reference architecture demonstrating the "art of the possible" and enabling manufactures to jumpstart development of innovative smart product services. Using the Smart Product Solution, manufactures can rapidly deploy and build upon an open source architecture to enable smart product applications by converting valuable information from the real world into digital data that provides increased visibility to businesses of how users interact their products or services.

## Running unit tests for customization
* Clone the repository, then make the desired code changes
* Next, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests
```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

## Building distributable for customization
* Configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket
```
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code
export SOLUTION_NAME=my-smart-solution # user defined solution's name
```
_Note:_ You would have to create an S3 bucket with the prefix 'my-bucket-name-<aws_region>'; aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets in bucket should be publicly accessible.

* Now build the distributable:
```
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $$VERSION
```

* Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. _Note:_ you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.
```
aws s3 cp ./global-s3-assets/ s3://my-bucket-name-<aws_region>/smart-product-solution/<my-version>/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control --profile aws-cred-profile-name
aws s3 cp ./regional-s3-assets/ s3://my-bucket-name-<aws_region>/smart-product-solution/<my-version>/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control --profile aws-cred-profile-name
```

* Get the link of the smart-product-solution.template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
* Deploy the Smart Product solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the smart-product-solution.template.

## File Structure
The Smart Product solution consists of a management and owner console, IoT integrations and API microservices that facilitate the functional areas of the solution.
